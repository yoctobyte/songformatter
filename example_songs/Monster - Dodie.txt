E
Tell me again about how it hurts
Am
Being awfully loud for an introvert
E
Get out of my room, smile wiped clean
Am
Isn't it weird to be so mean?


E
I'm guessing that I've grown horns
E
I guess I'm human no more
Am
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
    E
Oh, how easily passion twists
E
You think I'm a crazy bitch
Am
I craft my words to fit your head
       C              D
'Cause no one listens to the dead


E
  So maybe I will talk to you
E7
  The only way I know how to
A
Mhm, I've said my speech
A
Mhm, through sharpened teeth
Am                                            C
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin
       D
Please let the devil in


E
A meter apart, we blankly stare
Am
We shout in our heads, "Are you still in there?"
E
Well this ends bad then, we knew it would
Am
So we won't eat our words, 'cause they don't taste good


E
I'm guessing that I've grown horns
E
I guess I'm human no more
Am
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
    E
Oh. how easily passion twists
E
You think I'm a crazy bitch
Am
A thousand words are left unsaid
       C              D
'Cause no one listens to the dead


E
So maybe I will talk to you
E7
The only way I know how to
A
Mhm, I've said my speech
A
Mhm, through sharpened teeth
Am
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin


E
Oh, I think it might be worth a try
E7
Oh, am I ready to let this die?
A
Mhm, a monster's here
A
Mhm, you plug your ears
Am                                   C
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
       D
Please let the devil in

/P
E                E7
We won't eat our words 
A                   Am
They don't taste so good 
E                E7
We won't eat our words 
A                   Am
They don't taste so good 


E
Look, we know that I've seen this before 
E7
High and mighty, at the top of your list
A
Adoring every move, now my rank is sinking
Am
But we're both guilty of black or white thinking
E
And through my red eyes, you look pale
E7
All of your scars are looking more like scales
A
Two ugly creatures, two sinister preachers
Am
Blind to the past, like a couple of monsters
Just a couple of monsters!


E
So maybe I will talk to you
E7
The only way I know how to
A
Mhm, you've said your speech
A
Mhm, through sharpened teeth
Am
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin


E
Oh, I think it might be worth a try
E7
Oh, am I ready to let this die?
A
Mhm, a monster's here
A
Mhm, you plug your ears
Am                                   C
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
       D                E
Please let the devil in


E                E7
We won't eat our words 
A                   Am
They don't taste so good 
E                E7
We won't eat our words 
A                   Am   E
They don't taste so good
