[Verse]
C
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
C
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb.
      F                                      C     F C
I was soft inside, there was something goin' on
C
You do something to me that I can't explain
C                                          F
  Hold me closer and I feel no pain, ev'ry beat of my heart
                        C
We got something goin' on
 
[Pre-Chorus]
               Fmaj7
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Fm
  All this love we feel needs no conversation
   C
We ride it together, uh huh
        C
Makin' love with each other, uh huh
 
[Chorus]
           C                        F
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
          Dm
No one in between, how can we be wrong
          C             F
Sail away with me to another world
         C
And we rely on each other, uh huh
          Dm                  C
From one lover to another, uh huh
 
[Verse]
G#
I can't live without you if the love was gone
G#
Ev'rything is nothing if you got no one
            C#
And you did walk in the night
                           G#         C# G#
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing
    G#
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
G#
  Too deep in love and we got no way out
        C#
And the message is clear, this could be the year
        G#
For the real thing
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                 C#maj7
No more will you cry. Baby I will hurt you never
   C#m
We start and end as one in love forever we can
G#
Ride it together, uh huh
        G#
Makin' love with each other, uh huh
 
[Chorus]
           G#                       C#

No one in between, how can we be wrong
          G#            C#
Sail away with me to another world

From one lover to another, uh huh
