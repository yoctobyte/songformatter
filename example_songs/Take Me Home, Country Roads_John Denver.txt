G              Em            
Almost Heaven, West Virginia,

Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
G                    Em
Life is old there, older than the trees, 
                    D                           C  G
younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.

Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

All my memories  gather 'round her, 
D               C                G
miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
G                 Em                    
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, 
D                         C              G
misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
 
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong

 I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
    C       G              D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    Em               F            C              G
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home 
D                D7
yesterday, yesterday.
 
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong

Take me home, (down) country roads.

Take me home, (down) country roads.
