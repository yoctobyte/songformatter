Am
You and me
  Em            Dm
We used to be together
G           Em       Dm    G
Every day together always
 
  Am           Em
I really feel
         Dm        G
That I'm losing my best friend
  Em
I can't believe
     Am        Dm      G
This could be the end
 
   Am       Em    Dm              G
It looks as though you're letting go
    C
And if it's real,
     G               A
Well I don't want to know
 
 
 
Dm
Don't speak
  Gm                    C
I know just what you're saying
A                 Gm
So please stop explaining
      A                 Dm     Gm   A
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
 
Dm
Don't speak
  Gm               C
I know what you're thinking
A                 Gm
I don't need your reasons
      A                 Dm     Gm   C
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
 
 
 
    Am
Our memories
Em             Dm
They can be inviting
              G
But some are altogether
Em      Dm          G
Mighty frightening
 
Am    Em  Dm            G    C
As we die, both you and I
                   G
With my head in my hands
           A
I sit and cry
 
 
 
Dm
Don't speak
   Gm                    C

A                 Gm

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Dm
Don't speak

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
 
 
 
Bb        F
It's all ending
          Ab     Eb             Gb    Ebm/C  F7sus4 F7
