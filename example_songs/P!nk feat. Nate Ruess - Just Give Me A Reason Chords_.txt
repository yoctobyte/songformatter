   Em       D  A/C#        D         G/B         C        G/B          Am        N.C. (G*)
 
 
G
  Right from the start
             C                 Em
You were a thief, you stole my heart
    C                 G
And I your willing victim
  G                                C                      Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C                      G
And with every touch you fixed them
 
 
    Em             D    A/C#    D      Dsus4
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
Em           D   A/C#   D   Dsus4
Things you never say to me, oh oh
Em           D      A/C# D
Tell me that you've had enough
G      C     G/B Dsus4  D
Of our love, our love
 
 
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
                             D/F#                         Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
 
 
    G                               C                     Em
I'm sorry, I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  C                     G
I thought that we were fine
 
(Oh, we had everything)
     G                              C                  Em
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
    C                 G
And it's all in your mind
 
(Yeah, but this is happening)
 
 
Em            D    A/C#     D       Dsus4
You've been having real bad dreams, oh oh
    Em          D  A/C#     D   Dsus4
You used to lie so close to me, oh oh
        Em           D    A/C#  D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  G         C     G/B Am         
Between our love, our love, 
  C     G/B Dsus4  D
oh our love, our love
 
 
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
                              D/F#                        Em
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                        Bm
You're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4           Em
And we can learn to love again
 
 
(Em)                Bm
Oh, tear ducts and rust
                 C
I'll fix it for us
                  D                      Em
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
                   Bm                    C
You're holding it in, you're pouring a drink
                  Am7    Dsus4 D
No, nothing is as bad as it    seems
N.C.
We'll come clean
 
 
N.C.
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
 
 
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough

And we can learn to love again
                             D/F#                         Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                            Bm
That we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
 
 
     D/F#                        Em
Ohh-ohh, we can learn to love again
