Mechan Trainor - I Made You Look


                 A
I could have my Gucci on
                 C#/F      F#m
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
               D
But even with nothin' on
E                 A
 Bet, I made you look (I made you look)



A
 I'll make you double take
A
 Soon as I walk away
A
 Call up your chiropractor
A
 Just in case your neck break
D               E                              A
 Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh?


A
 'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene
A
 Double up that sunscreen
A
 I'm 'bout to turn the heat up
A
 Gonna make your glasses steam
D               E                              A
 Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh?



              F#m
When I do my walk, walk
                                A
I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop
                                        B
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got
                                  E       D
Ladies if you feel me, this your bop, bop   (Bop bop, bop)



                 A

                            A
Yeah, I look good in my Versace dress (Take it off)
                        C#/F             F#m
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess
                  D
But even with my hoodie on
E                 A
 Bet, I made you look, mhmm (I made you look)



A
 And once you get a taste
A
 You'll never be the same
A
 This ain't that ordinary
       A
It's that fourteen karat cake
D               E                              A
 Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh?
