Tabbed by Toni Drobner
 
[Intro]
| D    | D    | G    | Gm   | x2
 
[Verse 1]
D                G             Gm      D      D/F#          G   Gm
Who knows what tomorrow brings    In a world, few hearts survive
D                 G           Gm            D     D/F#      G    G  G/F#
All I know is the way I feel     When it's real I keep it alive
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Em      A7              D          D/F#        G   G/B
The road is long  There are mountains       in our way
        C                 A7      G   A7
But we climb a step every day
 
[Chorus]
D            D/F#          G       G   G/F#               Em     D/F#
Love lift us up where we belong                 Where the eagles cry
     C             G  A7
On a mountain high
D            D/F#          G       G   G/F#         Em      D/F#
Love lift us up where we belong        Far from the world below
             F#         Bm      A/C#     D     G   Gm
up where the clear wind blows
 
[Verse 2]
D                G         Gm            D      D/F#           G   Gm
Some hang on to used to be    Live their lives,      looking behind
D              G         Gm          D     D/F#          G    G   G/F#
All we have is here and now  All our life, out there to find
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Em      A7              D          D/F#         G   G/B
The road is long  There are mountains       in our way
       C                  A7      G   A7
But we climb a step every day
 
[Chorus]
D                 D/F#     G         G   G/F#             Em        D/F#
Love lift us up where we belong                 Where the eagles cry
     C        G     A7
On a mountain high
D            D/F#           G     G   G/F#         Em       D/F#
Love lift us up where we belong       Far from the world we know

up where the clear wind blows
