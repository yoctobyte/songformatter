         A               F#m            Bm          E7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
         A                 F#m              Am
of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to have known
                                 F           E7
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello


       A           F#m           Bm       E7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
           A                 F#m            Am
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
                             F          E7          
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, 
D
very strange.



      G             Bm             C    ( G Bm C )
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back



         A               F#m             Bm         E7       
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass and
         A         F#m             Am
in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
                                 F             E7
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.

      G             Bm             C   ( G Bm C )
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                      Bm     C              E7
    A four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back



           A              F#m           Bm        E7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
           A                F#m            Am
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
                                      F
And though she feels as if she's in a play
       E7
She is anyway.



         A               F#m            Bm       E7
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
           A               F#m           Am
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
                            F           E7
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,
D
very strange.



      G             Bm             C   (G Bm C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back


[Outro]

A                   C#m            D    (A C#m D)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A                 C#m           D     (A C#m D)
There beneath the blue suburban skies.
      A
Penny Lane
