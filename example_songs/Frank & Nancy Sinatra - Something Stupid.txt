[Verse 1]
  D
I know I stand in line until you think 
                              Em           A  Em A
You have the time to spend an evening with me.
    Em           A                Em
And if we go someplace to dance I know that
          A                   D
There's a chance you won't be leaving with me.
 
 
[Chorus]
    D7
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place 
           G            Bb
And have a drink or two...
    Em            A               Em
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
          A              D
Something stupid, like I love you.
 
 
[Bridge]
      D7
I can see it in your eyes that you despise 
                                 G
The same old lines you heard the night before.
    E                                  E7
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
                    A            A7#5
And never seemed so right before.
 
 
[Verse 2]
  D
I practice everyday to find some clever lines
                   Em           A    Em A
To say to make the meaning come true.
    Em                A              Em           A
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
        D
And I'm alone with you.
 
 
[Chorus]
    D7
The time is right your perfume fills my head
                              G               Bb
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue.
    Em            A               Em
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
          A7            D
Something stupid like I love you.
 
 
[Musical Interlude]
D
Em A Em A
Em A Em A

[Chorus]
    D7
The time is right your perfume fills my head
                              G               Bb
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue.
    Em            A               Em
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
          A7            D          Bb
Something stupid like I love you.
 
 
[Outro]
  D        Bb
I love you...
  D        Bb
I love you...
  D        Bb
I love you...
