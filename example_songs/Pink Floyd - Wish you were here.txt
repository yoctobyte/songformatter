C                         D/F#
So, so you think you can tell,
             Am/E                   
Heaven from Hell, 
G
blue skies from pain.
                     D/F#                                     
Can you tell a green field 
			C
from a cold steel rail, 
Am
a smile from a veil,
                      G
Do you think you can tell?


                      C                   
Did they get you to trade 
D/F#
your heroes for ghosts,
                Am/E                                         
Hot ashes for trees, 
G
hot air for a cool breeze, 
D/F#
cold comfort for change,
                  C                     
And did you exchange 
Am
a walk on part in the war
G 
for a lead role in a cage?

C                               D/F#
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Am/E                                                  
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, 
D/F#
year after year,
                                  
Running over the same old ground. 
C
What have we found?
             Am                         
The same old fears.
	G 
Wish you were here
