                             Penny Lane - The Beatles


         B    B/A#       G#m7   B/F#    C#m7       F#
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs   
         B         B/A#    G#m7      B/F#  Bm7
Of every head he's had the pleasure  to    know
            G#m7b5               GM7         F#sus4    F#   F#sus4  F#
And all the people that come and go,  stop and say hello.     



       B      B/A#   G#m7   B/F#   C#m7     F#
On the corner is a   banker with a motorcar,
           B        B/A#      G#m7   B/F#       Bm7
The little children laugh at  him    behind his back.
        G#m7b5               Gmaj7       F#sus4       F#  
And the banker never wears a mack in the pouring rain,     
 E
very strange.


[Chorus]

      A             A/C#           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A                 A/C#          D               F#
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back



           B        B/A#  G#m7    B/F#    C#m7      F#
In Penny Lane there is a  fireman with an hourglass    
           B      B/A#  G#m7     B/F#    Bm7
And in his pocket is a  portrait of the  Queen 
            G#m7b5               Gmaj7         F#sus4        F#  F#sus4  F#
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine.

B  B/A#  G#m7  B/F#   C#m7 F#
ahhhhh
    B  B/A#  G#m7  B/F#   Bm7
ahh ahhh
   G#m7b5  Gmaj7           F#sus4 F#  E
ah ahhah       ah ah ah ah


[Chorus]

      A             A/C#           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
 A             A/C#            D              F#
     A four of fish and finger pie in summer, meanwhile back



           B       B/A#   G#m7   B/F#   C#m7       F#
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
           B        B/A#    G#m7    B/F#   Bm7
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
             G#m7b5                 Gmaj7        F#sus4  F#  F#sus4  F#
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway.



         B        B/A#   G#m7   B/F#    C#m7      F#
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
           B      B/A#    G#m7    B/F#  Bm7
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
             G#m7b5         Gmaj7       F#sus4        F#   
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,     
E
very strange.


[Chorus]

      A             A/C#           D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A                 A/C#          D               F#
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back


(Key change)


      B             B/D#           E
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
B                 B/D#          E
There beneath the blue suburban skies
      B
Penny Lane
