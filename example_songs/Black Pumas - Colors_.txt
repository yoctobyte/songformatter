I woke up to the morning sky, first
                 A
Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
                        E
When I get up off this ground, I shake leaves back down
        C#7
To the brown, brown, brown, brown

'Til I'm clean

    Then I walk where I'd be shaded by the trees 
By a meadow of green
             E
For about a mile
               C#7
I'm headed to town, town, town

              A
Little bitty blues bird flies
         E                               C#7
