I could have my Gucci on

I could wear my Louis Vuitton
               E
But even with nothin' on
F                 Bb
 Bet, I made you look (I made you look)


Bb
 I'll make you double take
Bb
 Soon as I walk away
Bb
 Call up your chiropractor
Bb
 Just in case your neck break
E               F                              Bb
 Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh?
Bb
 'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene
Bb
 Double up that sunscreen
Bb
 I'm 'bout to turn the heat up
Bb
 Gonna make your glasses steam
E               F                              Bb
 Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh?


              G
When I do my walk, walk
                                Bb
I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop
                                        B
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got
                                  F       E
Ladies if you feel me, this your bop, bop   (Bop bop, bop)

Yeah, I look good in my Versace dress (Take it off)
                        D/F#             G
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess
                  E
But even with my hoodie on
F                 Bb
 Bet, I made you look, mhmm (I made you look)


Bb
 And once you get a taste
Bb
 You'll never be the same
Bb
 This ain't that ordinary
       Bb
It's that fourteen karat cake
E               F                              Bb
