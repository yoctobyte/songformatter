     Dm                          A
If I give up the seat I've been saving
        Dm              Bb
To some elderly lady or man
      C
Am I being a good boy
            C7       F
Am I your pride and joy
        Bb             Eb           F
Mother please if your pleased say I am
 
 
        Dm                        A
And if while in the course of my duty
      Dm                  Bb
I perform an unfortunate take
           C
Would you punish me so,
     C7       F
unbelievably so
        Bb          Eb           F
Never again will I make that mistake
 
 
     Bbsus4                  F7
This feeling inside me could never deny me
                            Bb
The right to be wrong if I choose
          Bbm
And this pleasure I get
          F
>From say winning a bet
       Eb          F
Is to lose
 
 
          Dm                     A
When I'm drinking my Bonaparte Shandy
        Dm                    Bb
Eating more than enough apple pies
         C                          C7         F
Will I glance at my screen and see real human beings
           Bb
Starve to death
          Eb         F
Right in front of my eyes
 
 
        Dm                         A7
Nothing old, nothing new, nothing ventured
        Dm               Dm7          Bb
Nothing gained, nothing still-born or lost
         C                         C7           F
Nothing further than proof nothing wilder than youth
        Bb                        C
Nothing older than time nothing sweeter than wine
          A          A7         Dm          Dm7
Nothing physically, recklessly, hopelessly blind
        Bb
Nothing I couldn't say
         Gm         C7
Nothing why 'cos today
          F
Nothing rhymed
