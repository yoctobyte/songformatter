Here we go
                       Am
On this rollercoaster life we know
                            C
With those crazy highs and real deep lows
                  G
I really don't know why
 
 
    G
And I will go
                         Am
To the farthest place on earth I know
                      C
I can travel all the road, you see
                               G
‘Cause I know you’re there with me
 
 
Em           D/F#             G
   You don't have to slow me down
Em             D/F#      G
  Cause I will always be around
Em       D/F#             G
  I will find my way back home
         Am                    C     D
Where magnolia grows, where magnolia grows
 
 
G   Am
[Instrumental]
 
 
     G
But I guess you know
                Am
Why I do what I do and where I go
                        C
I try to fill an empty space inside
                           G
But I can't do that without you
 
 
Em            D/F#         G
  You're even with me in my dreams
Em        D/F#           G
  I see a sail, the seven seas
Em       D/F#           G
  I will try to find my way
              Am                            C          D
You're always there tomorrow, you're always there tomorrow
 
 
G
Here we go
                       Am

With those crazy highs and real deep lows
                   G

And I will go

To the farthest place on earth I know
                      C
I can travel all the road, you see
                              G
‘Cause I know you’re there with me
 
 
Em          D/F#            G
  You don't have to slow me down
Em             D/F#       G
  Cause I will always be around
Em       D/F#             G
  I will find my way back home
         Am                    C     D
Where magnolia grows, where magnolia grows

G
Here we go
                       Am
On this rollercoaster life we know
                      C
I can travel all the road, you see
                               G
‘Cause I know you’re there with me
         Am
‘Cause I know
     C
Oh I know
                 G
You're there with me
