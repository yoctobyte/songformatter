On the first part of the journey, 
      Em                 D6/9
I was looking at all the life. 
           Em                    D6/9
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things, 
          Em                 D6/9
There was sand and hills and rings.
    Em                       D6/9
The first thing I met, was a fly with a buzz, 
        Em           D6/9
And the sky, with no clouds. 
    Em                    D6/9
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry, 
        Em              D6/9
But the air was full of sound. 
 
     Em                           D6/9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
        Em                    D6/9
It felt good to be out of the rain.
       Em               D6/9
In the desert you can remember your name, 
             Em                  D6/9
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. 
 
Em      D6/9               Em      D6/9
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la (2x)
 
      Em               D6/9
After two days, in the desert sun, 
   Em                 D6/9
My skin began to turn red.
      Em                 D6/9
After three days, in the desert fun, 
      Em                 D6/9
I was looking at a river bed. 
        Em                  D6/9
And the story it told, of a river that flowed, 
        Em                  D6/9
Made me sad to think it was dead. 
 
              Em                           D6/9
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
        Em                    D6/9
It felt good to be out of the rain.
       Em               D6/9
In the desert you can remember your name, 
             Em                  D6/9
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.

La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la (2x)

      Em                   D6/9
After nine days, I let the horse run free, 
           Em                   D6/9
'Cause the desert had turned to sea. 
           Em                   D6/9
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
          Em                 D6/9
There was sand and hills and rings. 
    Em                          D6/9
The ocean is a desert, with its life underground, 
      Em                D6/9
And a perfect disguise above. 
          Em                  D6/9
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground, 
        Em                  D6/9
But the humans will give no love. 
 
              Em                           D6/9
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
        Em                    D6/9
It felt good to be out of the rain.
       Em               D6/9
In the desert you can remember your name, 
             Em                  D6/9
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. 
 
Em      D6/9               Em      D6/9
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la (7x)
